# Prework-Study-Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this guide is to provide a central location for the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I built this guide to make the notes I was already taking by hand, accesible to me digitally across multiple devices. I learned how to enter the basic language of HTML code to make the content easy to read and readily available.

## Usage

With this Prework Study Guide, you can read through the notes in each of the four sections. There are notes for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. To randomly select what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open, either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser, with a suggestion on what to study first.
